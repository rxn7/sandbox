# Rotthin's Sandbox

Open source Minecraft-like voxel sandbox game.
This was made for fun and for practicing c++ and opengl.
The code is probably dogshit because I started learning c++ 3 days before starting this project.

## Features
#### Texture Packs
You can create your own texture pack. You just need to put in res/textures folder. It should appear in the textures drop down (see image below) and you can choose it.
